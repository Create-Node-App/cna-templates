# Testing Library and Jest Rules

## Test Organization

1. Group related tests using `describe` blocks
2. Use clear and descriptive test names
3. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. Keep tests focused and isolated
5. Use meaningful test descriptions

## Testing Library Best Practices

1. Test from the user's perspective
2. Use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc.)
3. Avoid testing implementation details
4. Use data-testid as a last resort
5. Follow Testing Library's guiding principles

## Jest Configuration

1. Use appropriate matchers for assertions
2. Configure test environment properly
3. Use meaningful mock implementations
4. Clean up after each test
5. Use proper setup and teardown methods

## Code Coverage

1. Maintain high test coverage for critical paths
2. Focus on testing user interactions
3. Include edge cases and error scenarios
4. Document complex test scenarios
5. Review coverage reports regularly
