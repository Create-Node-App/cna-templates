## Quick Start

```sh
fnm use
<%= installCommand%>
<%= runCommand%> dev
```

## Development Workflow

For most development work, you'll primarily use `<%= runCommand%> dev`. However, you have additional scripts at your disposal for various tasks:

| <%= runCommand%> <script>           | Description                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts the local development server for building and previewing your application.                                       |
| `npm run format`  | Formats the codebase using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistent code styling.                          |
| `npm run lint`    | Runs linting on the codebase to identify and report on patterns with [eslint](https://eslint.org/).                     |
| `npm run lint:fix`| Automatically fixes linting errors in the codebase where possible.                                                      |

## Production

Scripts for preparing and viewing the production version:

| <%= runCommand%> <script>             | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run start`     | Serves your application using the production setup, ensuring it's ready for deployment.           |
| `npm run build`     | Compiles the application into the `dist/` directory, preparing it for production deployment.      |
