## Core Guidelines

1. **Check Documentation First**
   - Always reference the `docs/` folder for technology-specific guides and patterns
   - Follow the README.md for setup, testing, and development instructions
   - Consult official documentation when uncertain

2. **Code Quality**
   - Run `npm run format` to format code automatically
   - Run `npm run lint:fix` to fix linting issues
   - Keep code clean, typed, and well-structured
   - Use TypeScript properly and avoid `any` types

3. **Project Structure**
   - Follow the established Feature-Based Architecture adapted for Next.js
   - Check `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for organization patterns
   - Keep features self-contained and modular
   - Use Next.js App Router conventions

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Test changes using the commands in README.md
   - Follow the project's established patterns and conventions
   - Reference existing code for consistency
   - Leverage Next.js Server Components appropriately

5. **Best Practices**
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
   - Use proper error handling and validation
   - Follow React, Next.js, and TypeScript best practices
   - Implement proper loading and error states

## When Adding New Features

1. Check if similar patterns exist in the codebase
2. Look for relevant guides in the `docs/` folder
3. Follow the project's established architecture
4. Add appropriate tests if testing is configured
5. Update documentation if significant changes are made
