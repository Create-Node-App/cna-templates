## Prerequisites
```sh
fnm use
<%= installCommand %>
```

## Bootstrap
Run from repo root:
```sh
<%= runCommand %> build
```

## Repo Structure
See `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`. Top-level:
- `apps/` deployable applications
- `packages/` shared libraries

## Packages vs Apps
Put cross-cutting logic (ui, config, utils) in `packages/`. Keep app folders thinâ€”assemble features.

## Development Workflow
- Use Turborepo to leverage caching
- Run selective builds: `turbo run build --filter=app-web`
- Co-locate tests with source or in `__tests__` subfolders

## Code Standards
- Strict TypeScript
- Avoid tight coupling between packagesâ€”export stable APIs
- Keep public surface small & documented

## Branch & Commit Strategy
`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`. Conventional Commits. Rebase before PR.

## Dependency Management
Use workspace ranges. If a package depends on another local package, reference it via workspace. Avoid duplicate versions.

## Build & Caching
Leverage incremental builds. Donâ€™t disable caching unless debugging.

## Testing
Each package/app should define its own test scripts. Add tests for shared utilities first.

## Versioning & Releases
Managed via Changesets. Follow prompts: `npx changeset` then version & publish workflows.

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Lint & type check pass
- [ ] Tests added/updated or rationale provided
- [ ] No circular deps introduced
- [ ] Changeset added if publishing impact
- [ ] Docs updated if needed

Happy contributing! ðŸš€
