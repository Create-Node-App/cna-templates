## Prerequisites
```sh
fnm use
<%= installCommand%>
```

## Bootstrap
Local run:
```sh
<%= runCommand%> test:local
```
Remote (Selenoid / grid):
```sh
<%= runCommand%> test:remote
```

## Test Architecture
See [docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md). Organize by feature/domain. Reuse helpers in `config/` and any shared utils.

## Spec Authoring Guidelines
- Keep specs deterministic
- Avoid fixed sleepsâ€”prefer waits on conditions
- One clear assertion focus per spec block (grouped logically)

## Selectors & Stability
Prefer data attributes (e.g. `data-testid`). Avoid brittle chained CSS unless necessary.

## Parallel & Retry Strategy
Use configuration values to scale. Keep flake low: investigate timing issues instead of piling retries.

## Branch & Commit Strategy
`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`. Conventional Commits. Rebase before PR.

## Dependencies
Add with cautionâ€”ensure reduced runtime or test flakiness risk.

## Reporting & Artifacts
Configure reporters in `wdio.conf.js`. Include logs/screenshots for failing specs.

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Specs deterministic
- [ ] Lint & type check pass
- [ ] No accidental focus (`it.only` / `describe.only`)
- [ ] New helpers documented
- [ ] Flaky logic addressed or explained
