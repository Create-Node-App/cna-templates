# Page Object Rules for WDIO Starter

## Page Object Structure

1. Use a class for each page object
2. Define selectors as class properties
3. Implement methods for page actions
4. Keep page objects focused on a single page or component
5. Use TypeScript for type safety

## Page Object Best Practices

1. Reuse selectors and methods where possible
2. Avoid hardcoded values
3. Keep page objects DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. Document methods and selectors
5. Keep page objects up to date with UI changes
