# Coding Style Rules for WDIO Starter

## File Organization

1. Use consistent file naming conventions
2. Organize tests by feature or functionality
3. Place page objects in a dedicated folder
4. Keep configuration files separate
5. Use TypeScript for type safety

## Code Style

1. Use 2 spaces for indentation
2. Use semicolons at the end of statements
3. Use single quotes for strings
4. Use template literals for string interpolation
5. Use arrow functions for callbacks
6. Use async/await for asynchronous operations
7. Use proper TypeScript types and avoid `any`

## Comments and Documentation

1. Use JSDoc for function and class documentation
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Keep comments up to date with code changes
4. Use TODO comments for future improvements
5. Document test cases and page objects
