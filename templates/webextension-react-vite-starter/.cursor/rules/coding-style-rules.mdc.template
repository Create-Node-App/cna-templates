# Coding Style Rules for WebExtension React Vite Starter

## File Organization

1. Use consistent file naming conventions
2. Organize code by feature or extension area
3. Place shared types and utilities in a common folder
4. Use TypeScript for type safety
5. Keep configuration files separate

## Code Style

1. Use 2 spaces for indentation
2. Use semicolons at the end of statements
3. Use single quotes for strings
4. Use template literals for string interpolation
5. Use arrow functions for callbacks
6. Use async/await for asynchronous operations
7. Use proper TypeScript types and avoid `any`

## Comments and Documentation

1. Use JSDoc for function and component documentation
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Keep comments up to date with code changes
4. Use TODO comments for future improvements
5. Document extension APIs and manifest
