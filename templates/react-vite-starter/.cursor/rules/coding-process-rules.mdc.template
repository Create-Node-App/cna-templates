# Coding Process Rules for React Vite Starter

## Development Workflow

1. Follow the feature-based development process:
   - Create new features in the `features` directory
   - Implement feature-specific components, hooks, and utilities
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation as needed

2. Testing Requirements:
   - Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
   - Write component tests for UI elements
   - Write integration tests for feature workflows
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%

3. Code Review Process:
   - Follow the project's code review guidelines
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Check for performance implications
   - Review accessibility compliance

## Feature Implementation

1. New Feature Structure:
   ```
   features/
     feature-name/
       components/
       hooks/
       utils/
       types/
       constants/
       tests/
       index.ts
       README.md
   ```

2. Implementation Steps:
   - Define feature requirements
   - Create necessary types and interfaces
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add tests
   - Document the feature
   - Review and refactor

## Performance Considerations

1. Use Vite's build optimizations
2. Implement proper code splitting
3. Optimize images and assets
4. Implement proper caching strategies
5. Monitor and optimize bundle size

## Security Guidelines

1. Follow React security best practices
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Sanitize user inputs
4. Use environment variables for sensitive data
5. Keep dependencies updated
